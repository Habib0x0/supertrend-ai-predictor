📈 Prediction Methods Explained
1. Simple Momentum

Analyzes basic price momentum over the lookback period
Best for: Trending markets with clear directional moves
Formula: momentum = price_change / lookback_period

2. RSI + MACD

Combines RSI oversold/overbought levels with MACD crossovers
Best for: Markets with clear momentum shifts
Weights: RSI (60%) + MACD (40%)

3. Weighted Multi-Factor (Recommended)

Sophisticated blend of multiple indicators with dynamic weighting
Factors considered:

RSI momentum (25%)
MACD signals (25%)
Bollinger Band position (20%)
Price momentum (20%)
Volume trend (10%)


Adapts weights based on market volatility
Best for: Most market conditions

4. ML-Style Ensemble

Uses ensemble learning concepts with non-linear combinations
Employs custom tanh approximation for bounded outputs
Combines multiple timeframes and indicators
Best for: Experienced traders who understand ensemble methods

🎯 Signal Interpretation
SuperTrend Signals

Green Line: Uptrend - prices above the line suggest bullish momentum
Red Line: Downtrend - prices below the line suggest bearish momentum
BUY Signal: Appears when trend changes from down to up
SELL Signal: Appears when trend changes from up to down

Prediction Signals

Blue Circles: Base price predictions
Lime Crosses: Bullish targets (during uptrends)
Fuchsia Crosses: Bearish targets (during downtrends)
Confidence Bands: Shaded areas showing prediction uncertainty

Information Table

Trend: Current SuperTrend direction
Signal: Bullish or bearish prediction
Confidence: Reliability percentage (higher is better)
RSI: Current RSI value with color coding
Volatility: Market volatility level (LOW/MED/HIGH)

📊 Usage Examples
Scalping Strategy

Use Simple Momentum method
Set ATR Period to 7
Enable trend change alerts
Focus on high-confidence signals (>70%)

Swing Trading

Use Weighted Multi-Factor method
Keep default settings (ATR 14, Multiplier 2.5)
Wait for trend confirmation + prediction alignment
Use prediction targets for profit taking

Position Trading

Use ML-Style Ensemble method
Increase ATR Period to 21
Focus on strong trend changes with high confidence
Use weekly/daily timeframes

⚠️ Risk Management
Best Practices

Never rely solely on any indicator - always use multiple confirmations
Set stop losses based on SuperTrend levels
Position sizing should account for confidence levels
Backtest thoroughly before live trading
Monitor market conditions - algorithm performance varies by market regime

Confidence Level Guidelines

>80%: High confidence - consider larger position sizes
60-80%: Medium confidence - standard position sizing
<60%: Low confidence - reduce position size or avoid trade

🔧 Technical Details
Key Calculations

Adaptive ATR: ta.ema(atr, math.round(atr_period / 2))
Trend Strength: math.abs(ta.change(close, pred_length)) / ta.atr(pred_length)
Confidence: math.max(0.1, 1 - (volatility * 5))

Performance Optimization

Uses efficient Pine Script functions
Minimizes repainting through proper historical references
Adaptive smoothing reduces noise

🚨 Important Disclaimers
Trading Risks

Past performance does not guarantee future results
All trading involves risk of loss
This indicator is for educational purposes only
Always do your own research and risk management

Technical Limitations

No indicator is 100% accurate
Market conditions can change rapidly
Prediction algorithms may underperform in certain market regimes
Always combine with fundamental analysis

📚 Advanced Tips
Optimization

Lower timeframes: Reduce ATR period and increase smoothing
Higher timeframes: Increase ATR period for trend following
Volatile markets: Lower ATR multiplier
Stable markets: Higher ATR multiplier

Combining with Other Indicators

Volume analysis: Confirm signals with volume spikes
Support/Resistance: Use key levels for additional confirmation
Market structure: Consider higher timeframe trends

Alert Strategy

Set up trend change alerts for major timeframes
Use strong signal alerts for entry opportunities
Monitor high confidence predictions for position sizing
